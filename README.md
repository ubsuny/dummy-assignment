# Homework Example: Hello World
This example project is written in Python, and tested with pytest.

### The assignment
Write code to print "Hello World" and write a unit test.

#### Workflow
1. Fix or write code
2. Commit to new branch (e.g. "final submission")
3. Create Pull request (particularly important for later if you have group projects, but also to run the unit test automatically)
4. Merge Pull request
5. Upload result to UBlearns and add link to repository
